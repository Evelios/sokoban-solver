Elementary Solution

Puzzle State:
A puzzle state is a tuple that holds two elements. These elements are the worker position which is a coordinate stored as a tuple, and a tuple containing the box coordinates which are also stored as tuples..
Eg// ( (1,3), ((4, 2), (3, 4) (2, 2)) )

Actions:
The actions are all legal actions preformed by the worker. Actions include the worker walking in any of the 4 coordinate directions as long as there isn't a wall, and if there is a box in that adjacent location that is able to be pushed in that direction.

Goal State:
The goal state is reached when each box in the current state is in one of the locations indicated by the puzzles goal locations. By default the goal locations are the target locations.

Path Cost:
The path cost is equal to the ammount of times the worker has moved, which is the previous path cost plus one.

Heuristic:
The heuristic for the elementary solution is a relaxed version of the sokoban puzzle. The manhattan distance is the vertical and horizontal distance between two objects. The heuristic is the sum on the minnium manhattan distances from the boxes to an unused target location plus the manhattan distance from the worker to the nearest box. The minnimum manhattan distance between boxes means that for each target only the box with the smallest distance is used, then both the target and the box are taken out of consideration for the next minnimum distance calculation.
